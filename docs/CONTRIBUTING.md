## 🧩 How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```

2. **Make your changes** (code, docs, tests).
3. **Run tests** to ensure everything passes.

   ```bash
   dotnet test tests/Groovarr.Tests/Groovarr.Tests.csproj
   ```

4. **Commit with clear messages**:

   ```

5. **Push your branch** and open a Pull Request (PR).

## 🔄 Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused: one feature or fix per PR.
- Ensure all builds and tests pass in CI.
- Include documentation updates if your change adds or modifies functionality.
- Reference related issues in your PR description (`Fixes #123`).
- Expect review feedback — collaborative iteration is encouraged.

## 🛠 Coding Standards

- **Backend (C#/.NET)**:
  - Follow .NET coding conventions.
  - Use async/await for I/O operations.
  - Add XML comments for public methods so they appear in Swagger docs.
  - Keep persistence logic consistent with other ‑arr projects (`/config` for data).

- **Frontend (React/Vite)**:
  - Use functional components and hooks.
  - Follow ESLint/Prettier formatting rules.
  - Keep UI consistent with Groovarr’s design system.

- Update **API.md** for new endpoints.
- Update **DEV.md** for developer workflows.
- Keep docs clear, concise, and consistent.

## 🐛 Issues

- Use GitHub Issues to report bugs, request features, or ask questions.
- Include steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and environment details.
- Tag issues appropriately (`bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`).

---

## ✅ Community Values

- Be respectful and collaborative.
- Favor clarity and maintainability over clever hacks.
- Keep Groovarr consistent with the ‑arr ecosystem (simple archives, `/config` persistence, SQLite default).
- Encourage newcomers — Groovarr thrives on community contributions!
